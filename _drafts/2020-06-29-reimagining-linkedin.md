LinkedIn is profoundly broken. It may not seem that way based on pure numbers. Its valuation, its unicorn status, or its active user base. 

It's purpose is supposed to be: "connect the world's professionals to make them productive and successful."

Unfortunately, it fails on this on many fronts.

As [John Biggs](https://twitter.com/johnbiggs) puts it, "LinkedIn is a spam garden full of misspelled, grunty requests from international software houses that are looking, primarily, to sell you services. Because it’s LinkedIn it’s super easy to slip past any and all defenses against this spam and so I get messages like these on a daily basis."

With canned responses to people's career milestones, a constant "What's New" section which is not customized, and is a slightly remixed version of CNN to create panic, fear of missing out, or something else, LinkedIn fails as a feed.

LinkedIn fails as a recruiting tool as well. It forces people to be fake, and work on optimizing their profiles for ATS algorithms.

Not to mention the spam. The spam is constantly there, and it definitely sucks. The networks don't make sense, like they do on Twitter.

Most messages are spam. They are advertising. You know how you feel when you get a spam message in your SMS app or your phone? Yes, it's the same thing.

Undoubtedly, there is some value in it. 

> LinkedIn is genuinely not ready for employees of tomorrow, the future of work, or the economy of tomorrow.

LinkedIn reinforces a broken economic system that is being abandoned in droves.

The reason why it sucks is an effect by its very design. The best way to think about LinkedIn is a giant "networking event" where everyone is walking around carrying cards, wearing cheap suits, and people have little booths that they are trying to prop up to propose that they're the best in the world at something.

Think wet markets. 

-Unwanted connection requests
-Hard to use in an intuitive way

This isn't a discussion of whether hashtags or good or not. This isn't about looking at the feed or not and how it's filled with empty spam.

- Useless feed. Inspirational quotes from billionaires is not a good thing to post. It doesn't work.
- Bosses vs leaders and other useless posts.

It is just a heaping pile of garbage.

Building a brand is useless. Reid Hoffman was perhaps inspired by writing "The Startup of You" to think of yourself as a brand. I think this brand based thinking has gone far enough. Sorry, but you and I are not brands. We are not hollow corporate entities.

We are humans and we need a different language and a metaphor. We need to think in terms of authenticity. Hollow-selves and hollow-suits.

It's not about paying to be social either. The LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a crappy product. 

> What's the point of network effects if everyone HATES your product and feel forced to use it anyways?

Kim Kardashian has network effects because she's popular. But just because something is popular (a cruder way of saying less popular), doesn't make it good. VCs and others have bought into this idea that popular = good, engagement = good.

Hollow experiences, dehumanizing stiffness are not goods.

So, here we have A Modest Proposal to Re-make LinkedIn.

In writing this, I have 3 goals:
- Making LinkedIn genuinely useful to professionals, to job seekers and makers.
- Get genuine usage on LinkedIn. Most posts otherwise are sleazy salesy messages.
- Make networking more useful.
- Make job seeking and recruiting easier.

## Useful to Professionals

For something to be useful, it has to be genuine. And genuineness is something that LinkedIn does not promote in any way. 

What about money?
LinkedIn can run on advertising alone. Not on private messages, but based on feed. The other option is to pay for a pro account which removes advertising, or it enhances the experiences in some other ways.

I know that Networks Effects is the lingo of the tech world. Just because there's a network effect doesn't make it useful.



Do the words force, compulsion, misery, also part of the lexicon?
