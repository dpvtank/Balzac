LinkedIn is the kid everyone is forced to play with on the playground, even though nobody wants to. Not because he's unskilled, but because he makes the game less fun for everyone. He also forces others to play the game only in the way he wants to play.

While this kid's parents (Reid & Satya) might think "how wonderful it is that everyone is playing with my kid," they don't necessarily see how miserable everyone is as they do.

However, this kid is smart and has the ability to change the rules of the game for the better. He just needs to listen to other kids, and understand what they want to play. If he can do that, the entire game can change completely.

He might even find out that others eagerly genuinely **want** to play with him then.

In this essay, I want to go over what's broken about LinkedIn, the future of work, and how LinkedIn can become a powerful player in this new economy.

This isn't about minor things like interface changes and some broken features in the mobile app, but an entirely different philosophy altogether.

Let's get to it.

# The Problem

There are two sets of problems with LinkedIn. The surface is what we see and what annoys us the most. The second is more philosophical. It is about the metaphors and narratives that are implicitly baked into the product and service. These are the roots of not only a broken product, but a broken approach to work itself.

As I go through these details, a note to those reading this internally that the metrics might show a different story. However, I do not believe high engagement necessarily means positive feelings and opinions about LinkedIn. Its leaders should note that metrics that emerge from compulsion do not indicate a strong ecosystem. There's a reason why alternative networks are popping up that tackle this challenge differently, and they are growing fast. Companies like [BlueCrew](https://bluecrewjobs.com) and [Jobcase](https://jobcase.com), even though they are focused on blue collar jobs, are doing a much better job (pun fully intended) at understanding the needs of its users.

_(Yes, I know they are not strict social networks.)_

## LinkedIn's Surface Problems

### The Spam
As [John Biggs](https://twitter.com/johnbiggs) puts it, "LinkedIn is a spam garden full of misspelled, grunty requests from international software houses that are looking, primarily, to sell you services. Because it’s LinkedIn it’s super easy to slip past any and all defenses against this spam and so I get messages like these on a daily basis."

I believe this first one is self-explanatory.

### The Feed
The constant feed on LinkedIn is like a giant wet market where people are mostly engaged in virtue signaling. This is why we get either dreadfully boring industry news about completely unrelated fields on our timeline from friends which we are forced to like (even though we don't understand a word of it), or we get the useless posts about the inspiring wisdom of billionaires with #so #many #hashtags #to #make #it #noticeable #to #others.

This doesn't even count the "Breaking News" section on the top left corner that highlights 

The best way to think about LinkedIn is a giant "networking event" where everyone is walking around carrying cards, wearing cheap suits, and people have little booths that they are trying to prop up to propose that they're the best in the world at something.

Think wet markets. 

-Unwanted connection requests
-Hard to use in an intuitive way

This isn't a discussion of whether hashtags or good or not. This isn't about looking at the feed or not and how it's filled with empty spam.

- Useless feed. Inspirational quotes from billionaires is not a good thing to post. It doesn't work.
- Bosses vs leaders and other useless posts.

it's mostly virtue signalling. "people are afraid to share news that they actually care about. Instead, they share news that they wish they cared about"

"    “Does this article show that I know what’s going on in my industry?”
    “Is this article inspirational without making me look too religious, and put me at risk of losing my job?”
    “If my boss reads this article, will he think that I posted it because I think that he is incompetent?”

Eventually it gets too hard, and you end up sharing a horribly boring article about “industry trends” because it has some pretty charts and it’s almost time for your lunch break."

LinkedIn feeds a different type of social media resentment. Like how Instagram makes us self-conscious about our happiness, our physical bodies, our lifestyles, LinkedIn does that to professional success. I'm sorry Gary V, I don't care about your overhyped garbage:

It is just a heaping pile of garbage.


LinkedIn is not ready for the future of work. With its profoundly broken system, it encourages the existing system which makes people miserable, bored, and exhausted from engaging in "professional" learning.

LinkedIn, maybe just due to its size, is the kid no one wants to play with on the playground but is forced to. 

This has given rise to an entire ecosystem whose entire job titles are about how to hack, fix, push, pull the levers of LinkedIn. This would be okay if it were companies trying to optimize for customers and potential candidates. But it is candidates themsleves who are commoditizing themselves.

To reimagine LinkedIn is to realistically look at the future of work, role of the individual, work that makes us happy, and the need of the economy that is meant to make us constant learners, connectors, creators, and makers. LinkedIn as a system is not at all ready for this revolution.

If anything, LinkedIn is a reactive system where people line up to stand out in a sea of sameness. 

LinkedIn is profoundly broken. It may not seem that way based on pure numbers. Its valuation, its unicorn status, or its active user base. 

It's purpose is supposed to be: "connect the world's professionals to make them productive and successful."

Unfortunately, it fails on this on many fronts.

With canned responses to people's career milestones, a constant "What's New" section which is not customized, and is a slightly remixed version of CNN to create panic, fear of missing out, or something else, LinkedIn fails as a feed.

LinkedIn fails as a recruiting tool as well. It forces people to be fake, and work on optimizing their profiles for ATS algorithms.

Not to mention the spam. The spam is constantly there, and it definitely sucks. The networks don't make sense, like they do on Twitter.

Undoubtedly, there is some value in it. 

> LinkedIn is genuinely not ready for employees of tomorrow, the future of work, or the economy of tomorrow.

LinkedIn reinforces a broken economic system that is being abandoned in droves.

The reason why it sucks is an effect by its very design. 

Building a brand is useless. Reid Hoffman was perhaps inspired by writing "The Startup of You" to think of yourself as a brand. I think this brand based thinking has gone far enough. Sorry, but you and I are not brands. We are not hollow corporate entities.

What exactly are skills? Tons of people endorse me for Strategy, but what exactly does that mean? 

We are humans and we need a different language and a metaphor. We need to think in terms of authenticity. Hollow-selves and hollow-suits.

It's not about paying to be social either. The LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a crappy product. 

> What's the point of network effects if everyone HATES your product and feel forced to use it anyways?

Kim Kardashian has network effects because she's popular. But just because something is popular (a cruder way of saying less popular), doesn't make it good. VCs and others have bought into this idea that popular = good, engagement = good.

Hollow experiences, dehumanizing stiffness are not goods.

So, here we have A Modest Proposal to Re-make LinkedIn.

In writing this, I have 3 goals:
- Making LinkedIn genuinely useful to professionals, to job seekers and makers.
- Get genuine usage on LinkedIn. Most posts otherwise are sleazy salesy messages.
- Make networking more useful.
- Make job seeking and recruiting easier.

## Useful to Professionals

For something to be useful, it has to be genuine. And genuineness is something that LinkedIn does not promote in any way. 

What about money?
LinkedIn can run on advertising alone. Not on private messages, but based on feed. The other option is to pay for a pro account which removes advertising, or it enhances the experiences in some other ways.

I know that Networks Effects is the lingo of the tech world. Just because there's a network effect doesn't make it useful.

Do the words force, compulsion, misery, also part of the lexicon?

Here's a basic tenet of human psychology that's worth considering. People want to feel approved of. They want to feel useful. They want to feel recognized for what they do. LinkedIn allows for only the most shallow and hollow way of making that happen.

It starts with the profile. When a user creates an account, let him build on a canvas. Make it about him, don't make him into the product.

A blank canvas, and a chance to dip in and out of conversations. Think Twitter, but more substantial. Not tweetthreads, not empty nothing, but real conversations. Let him dip in and out of his groups. His college group, his professional group, his volunteer group, sure. But also his marketing group, his whatever group. The group can be the central point of consuming, sharing, and contributing to content.

And actually, change the idea of content and instead make it about knowledge.

How does that happen? There are tens of millions of mostly unused and abandoned group. Groups are feeds. They are rivers where a person can dip into it and join anytime he or she wants.

Rivers where he can paddle when he wants. Hike when he wants, etc. This is an adventure, this is time in nature. The work of work on social media should not feel like work. It should feel like gardening or like an adventure.

So, say you're into marketing, or perhaps into engineering. Let me dip into the marketing stream. See what people are writing about. If someone catches my eye in that stream, let me comment on her post. Let me follow her. Let me build a connection with her. This relationship works in the context of that stream only. This is not an unsolicated connection request to "network" and then spam.

Of course at this point, the question becomes, how do you ensure that the topics are swimmable and navigateable? After all, marketing as a worldwide topic is massive and hard to take in. So to counter that, there are 5-10 solutions:
1. Make it geography limited.
2. Randomly present the feed, and refine based on engagement.
3. `

The other thing it needs is perhaps a better set of editors who share the right set of news. Think Economist Espresso, now BuzzFeed level garbage.

The opportunity for LinkedIn:

LinkedIn can be the catalyst for the future of work. It can use its massive number of users to actually create something good, give people a chance to be human, to focus on learning and growth and mutually helping one another. But instead, it optimizes for algorithmic popularity.

In an era where most people dislike their jobs, LinkedIn feeds the machine even more.

| Future of Work | LinkedIn |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Blend of professional & personal work | Chronological professional work only |
| Project based | Titled based |
| Multi-dimensional talents, skills, abilities | One core thing you have to be about |
| Continuous Learning based | Credential based |
| Tapping into new networks & opportunities | All about existing networks |
| Sharing | Spammy wall of text |
| Worker in the driver's seat | Spammy, self-promotional experiences |
| Proactive | Reactive |

The solution?
A mix of Mighty Networks + Twitter + Wikipedia + Medium.

1. Individuals at the heart
2. Groups and tribes around the individual
3. Companies around the groups (multiple groups)
4. All interconnected with content

1. An individual makes a profile. Not just a static profile, but as aspirational one as well. This is the real value of wanting to use LinkedIn. People want to grow, evolve, etc. But LinkedIn doesn't allow this. Imagine if you got a way to understand your talents, your passions, your abilities through tests, through talks, through whatever. Imagine if that was the first step of LinkedIn. NOT: let's fill out a resume.
This would make a person WANT to use LinkedIn. It also changes the tone of what this social network can be. Not a static look at what has been, but what you can be. Hope hooks the heart. LinkedIn right not hooks a self-loating mind.

People need to be someone you tap into from time to time. You don't necessarily follow all their updates. Let people join the content creators. 

It needs to be a content first platform. It needs to be about professional learning, and less about professional networking, which has truth-creep at its center (the tendency to exagerate and self-aggrandizement). Demonstrating knowledge is the real means of growth. That's it. Demonstrate knowledge, share your learnings, grow.

If I'm not a lawyer, I don't care. So don't show me that crap. Same network, different tribes.
