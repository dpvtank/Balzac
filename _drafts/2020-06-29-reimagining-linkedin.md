LinkedIn is profoundly broken. It may not seem that way based on pure numbers. Its valuation, its unicorn status, or its active user base. 

It's purpose is supposed to be: "connect the world's professionals to make them productive and successful."

Unfortunately, it fails on this on many fronts.

As [John Biggs](https://twitter.com/johnbiggs) puts it, "LinkedIn is a spam garden full of misspelled, grunty requests from international software houses that are looking, primarily, to sell you services. Because it’s LinkedIn it’s super easy to slip past any and all defenses against this spam and so I get messages like these on a daily basis."

With canned responses to people's career milestones, a constant "What's New" section which is not customized, and is a slightly remixed version of CNN to create panic, fear of missing out, or something else, LinkedIn fails as a feed.

LinkedIn fails as a recruiting tool as well. It forces people to be fake, and work on optimizing their profiles for ATS algorithms.

Not to mention the spam. The spam is constantly there, and it definitely sucks. The networks don't make sense, like they do on Twitter.

So, here we have A Modest Proposal to Re-make LinkedIn.

In writing this, I have 3 goals:
- Making LinkedIn genuinely useful to professionals, to job seekers and makers.
- Get genuine usage on LinkedIn. Most posts otherwise are sleazy salesy messages.
- Make networking more useful.
- Make job seeking and recruiting easier.



What about money?
LinkedIn can run on advertising alone. Not on private messages, but based on feed. The other option is to pay for a pro account which removes advertising, or it enhances the experiences in some other ways.

I know that Networks Effects is the lingo of the tech world. Just because there's a network effect doesn't make it useful.

> What's the point of network effects if everyone HATES your product and feel forced to use it anyways?

Do the words force, compulsion, misery, also part of the lexicon?
