LinkedIn is the kid everyone is forced to play with on the playground, even though nobody wants to. Not because he's unskilled, but because he makes the game less fun for everyone. He also forces others to play the game only in the way he wants to play.

While this kid's parents (Reid & Satya) might think "how wonderful it is that everyone is playing with my kid," they don't necessarily see how miserable everyone is as they do.

However, this kid is smart and has the ability to change the rules of the game for the better. He just needs to listen to other kids, and understand what they want to play. If he can do that, the entire game can change completely.

He might even find out that others eagerly genuinely **want** to play with him then. To reimagine LinkedIn is to realistically look at the future of work, role of the individual, work that makes us happy, and the need of the economy that is meant to make us constant learners, connectors, creators, and makers. LinkedIn as a system is not at all ready for this revolution. If anything, LinkedIn is fixed in an old model that keeps things stuck in the past.

In this essay, I want to go over what's broken about LinkedIn, the future of work, and how LinkedIn can become a powerful player in this new economy.

This isn't about minor things like interface changes and some broken features in the mobile app, but an entirely different philosophy altogether.

Let's get to it.

# The Problems

There are surface issues with LinkedIn, and they stem from a deeper underlying philosophy, metaphor and narrative that are implicitly baked into the product and service. These are the roots of not only a broken product, but a broken approach to work itself.

In this section, I want to discuss where LinkedIn has left its users behind and left a vast chasm of unmet needs.

As I go through these details, a note to those reading this internally that the metrics might show a different story. However, I do not believe high engagement necessarily means positive feelings and opinions about LinkedIn. Its leaders should note that metrics that emerge from compulsion do not indicate a strong ecosystem. There's a reason why alternative networks are popping up that tackle this challenge differently, and they are growing fast. Companies like [BlueCrew](https://bluecrewjobs.com) and [Jobcase](https://jobcase.com), even though they are focused on blue collar jobs, are doing a much better job (pun fully intended) at understanding the needs of its users.

_(Yes, I know they are not strict social networks.)_

> What's the point of network effects if everyone dislikes your product and feel forced to use it anyways?

Kim Kardashian has network effects because she's popular. But just because something is popular (a cruder way of saying less popular), doesn't make it good. 

## User as a Product, Advertiser/Recruiter as Customer

On LinkedIn, you are the product. This would not be so bad in and of itself, if it provided enough positive value to the user. However, it dramatically reduces the usefulness of the platform for the users themselves in a few key ways. 

_Note: I believe the future of LinkedIn could still involve making the user the product, but more intelligently engaging the users needs and understanding the future of work._

### Broken Way of Relating to Others

While the network of people you know can help you with your professional career, there is no organizing principle behind how you relate to people on LinkedIn. All connections are alike. This gives rise to some of the most tedious features on the site.

First, it muddies the experience of the feed. Say you are not a lawyer or have anything to do with the legal field at all. But your friend Michael is a lawyer. Michael constantly posts updates about the legal field. This makes his posts on your feed mostly useless. You cannot focus on the things you wish to learn, to grow in, etc. (Yes, I know there's an option to unfollow him so that I stop seeing his posts, but that's besides the point). What should have been a rich source of news, articles, help in things that matter to you all blurs into a mix of sameness.

Second, it gives rise to virtue signaling and bland content. The feed on LinkedIn is like a giant market where people are mostly confused about what to share so they are forced to virtue signal. This is why we get either dreadfully boring industry news about completely unrelated fields on our timeline from friends, or we get the useless posts about the inspiring wisdom of billionaires with #so #many #hashtags #to #make #it #noticeable #to #others. If people don't know who or what they're posting to, then what gets shared is not useful to anyone. So you post the absolute generic with no value.

LinkedIn also feeds a different type of social media resentment. Like how Instagram makes us self-conscious about our happiness, our physical bodies, our lifestyles, LinkedIn does that to professional success. I have had countless conversations with people of varying work experiences who feel a crushing sense of being left behind seeing out-of-context moves of their colleagues. Artificial and canned response only add to this type of broken and artificial relating with others.

This doesn't even count the "Breaking News" section on the top left corner that highlights click-baity anxiety producing news. While it is meant to be informative, it is not context driven, or user driven. Constructive Journalism might be a potential solution here.

Finally, it gives rise to artificial connections. You can either choose to accept connection requests from just the people you know well to curate your relationships carefully, but that reduces the value of **the network** (network effects). 

On the opposite spectrum, if you accept everyone's request, you drown in requests and the whole experience ends up being a spam filled mess.

It's a Catch-22. Connect with discretion, you lose. Connect with all, you lose.

### Broken Way of Representing Yourself

Like filling out a resume, you create a static profile which you can periodically update. You add your friends from college, from work, from the places you volunteer, etc. Someone might even leave an endorsement. You are forced to encapsulate a static version of who you are. 

It commoditizes people and forces them to act in stiff and artificial ways. We already saw its effects above in the form of artificial networking and virtue signaling. Instead of building a professional profile which can be dynamic, and just as much about what you want to be and where you want to grow into professionally, LinkedIn favors the past and static you.

Throughout all this, you are distinctly aware that you are a product that is here to sell yourself to others. This clouds your attitudes and actions on the platform.

When you commoditize yourself, you can't help but feel slightly dehumanized. It forces people to be fake. It makes them optimize for ATS algorithms for a job, and not for genuine connection or learning. 

This has given rise to an entire cottage industry of people whose entire job is to help you hack, fix, push, pull the levers of LinkedIn. This would be okay if it were companies trying to optimize for customers and potential candidates. But it is candidates themsleves who are commoditizing themselves. It is slightly shocking that people pay for the privelege of becoming more of a neat product.

**Most people don't want to think of themselves as a brand**. This brand-building myth has given rise to the over-inflated profiles that verge on the side of looking like spam. But once again, who's noticing, since that's all a mess anyways.

I think this brand based thinking has gone far enough. You and I are not brands. We are people. The real question is: how do we let our humanity shine through? I'll answer that later on in this essay.

For 95% of the people out there, their personal brands can simply be what they've learned, what they can do, and what they would want to learn and what they would like to do. And Lynda is an interesting platform, but it remains inaccessible to the majority of users who do not have a pro account.

Similarly, LinkedIn Groups are either silent ghost towns, or a self-promotional spam-fest of users shouting into the void to other self-promoters.

### Broken Recruiting

To recap so far: When the user is the product, and various networks are all lumped together, you create a feed that doesn't nourish your professional interests (or help you notice enough of the good news about your friends). You also end up either hyper-inflating your profile (BRANDING is what they'd call it) to stand apart from others, or retreat from it altogether. 

With content, knowledge, ideas, experiences all a jumbled mess, can true talent rise to the top? Do the best candidates rise up from this environment?

LinkedIn's Recruiting Solutions rely heavily on ATS systems, or Application Tracking Systems. It relies on buzzword stuffing in your profile ("but it's supposed to be done organically and naturally!" they'll say).

In the same way that standardized tests only prove the ability of students to give standardized tests, the ATS system helps get candidates who know how to win the ATS game, not the best candidates in and of themselves. 

Better recruiting would be hyper focused based on networks and interests, and seeing those who are organically contributing the best lessons, engaging with the most content, and growing alone those lines. LinkedIn is not suited for that. I will propose a network-driven solution to recruiting later on in the essay that goes into this in more detail.

This old model of recruiting is static and does not always allow the candidates who are learning, growing, and increasingly resorting to unconvential means to gather experience. Projects, side startups, online hustles, volunteer work, etc are all other parts of what makes a person a person.

These valuable experiences, skills, and results are mostly ignored in a product that favors chronological discrete separation of professional experiences alone.

On the other hand, we have a broken advertiser experience. Since you are the product and the customer is the advertiser, this fuels the spammy messages that we get on there. As [John Biggs](https://twitter.com/johnbiggs) puts it, "LinkedIn is a spam garden full of misspelled, grunty requests from international software houses that are looking, primarily, to sell you services."

This spam filled experience is not just limited to our inbox either. It extends to our feed as well, as I've already discussed above.


# The Future of Work

The fact is simple: LinkedIn is not ready for the future of work. With its profoundly broken system, it encourages the existing system which makes people miserable, bored, and exhausted from engaging in "professional" networking. LinkedIn reinforces a broken economic system that is being abandoned in droves.

To remake LinkedIn requires you to understand the future of work. And then create that product experience.

> LinkedIn is genuinely not ready for employees of tomorrow, the future of work, nor the economy of tomorrow.

LinkedIn can be the catalyst for the future of work. It can use its massive number of users to actually create something good, give people a chance to be human, to focus on learning and growth and mutually helping one another. But instead, it optimizes for algorithmic popularity.

In an era where most people dislike their jobs, LinkedIn feeds the machine even more.

| Future of Work | LinkedIn |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Blend of professional & personal work | Chronological professional work only |
| Project based | Titled based |
| Multi-dimensional talents, skills, abilities | One core thing you have to be about |
| Continuous Learning based | Credential based |
| Tapping into new networks & opportunities | All about existing networks |
| Sharing | Spammy wall of text |
| Worker in the driver's seat | Spammy, self-promotional experiences |
| Proactive | Reactive |

What exactly are skills? Tons of people endorse me for Strategy, but what exactly does that mean? 

We are humans and we need a different language and a metaphor. We need to think in terms of authenticity. Hollow-selves and hollow-suits.



Hollow experiences, dehumanizing stiffness are not goods.

So, here we have A Modest Proposal to Re-make LinkedIn.

In writing this, I have 3 goals:
- Making LinkedIn genuinely useful to professionals, to job seekers and makers.
- Get genuine usage on LinkedIn. Most posts otherwise are sleazy salesy messages.
- Make networking more useful.
- Make job seeking and recruiting easier.

## Useful to Professionals

For something to be useful, it has to be genuine. And genuineness is something that LinkedIn does not promote in any way. 

What about money?
LinkedIn can run on advertising alone. Not on private messages, but based on feed. The other option is to pay for a pro account which removes advertising, or it enhances the experiences in some other ways.

Here's a basic tenet of human psychology that's worth considering. People want to feel approved of. They want to feel useful. They want to feel recognized for what they do. LinkedIn allows for only the most shallow and hollow way of making that happen.

It starts with the profile. When a user creates an account, let him build on a canvas. Make it about him, don't make him into the product.

A blank canvas, and a chance to dip in and out of conversations. Think Twitter, but more substantial. Not tweetthreads, not empty nothing, but real conversations. Let him dip in and out of his groups. His college group, his professional group, his volunteer group, sure. But also his marketing group, his whatever group. The group can be the central point of consuming, sharing, and contributing to content.

And actually, change the idea of content and instead make it about knowledge.

How does that happen? There are tens of millions of mostly unused and abandoned group. Groups are feeds. They are rivers where a person can dip into it and join anytime he or she wants.

Rivers where he can paddle when he wants. Hike when he wants, etc. This is an adventure, this is time in nature. The work of work on social media should not feel like work. It should feel like gardening or like an adventure.

So, say you're into marketing, or perhaps into engineering. Let me dip into the marketing stream. See what people are writing about. If someone catches my eye in that stream, let me comment on her post. Let me follow her. Let me build a connection with her. This relationship works in the context of that stream only. This is not an unsolicated connection request to "network" and then spam.

Of course at this point, the question becomes, how do you ensure that the topics are swimmable and navigateable? After all, marketing as a worldwide topic is massive and hard to take in. So to counter that, there are 5-10 solutions:
1. Make it geography limited.
2. Randomly present the feed, and refine based on engagement.
3. `

The other thing it needs is perhaps a better set of editors who share the right set of news. Think Economist Espresso, now BuzzFeed level garbage.

# Reimagining LinkedIn (The Solution)



The solution?
A mix of Mighty Networks + Twitter + Wikipedia + Medium.

1. Individuals at the heart
2. Groups and tribes around the individual
3. Companies around the groups (multiple groups)
4. All interconnected with content

1. An individual makes a profile. Not just a static profile, but as aspirational one as well. This is the real value of wanting to use LinkedIn. People want to grow, evolve, etc. But LinkedIn doesn't allow this. Imagine if you got a way to understand your talents, your passions, your abilities through tests, through talks, through whatever. Imagine if that was the first step of LinkedIn. NOT: let's fill out a resume.
This would make a person WANT to use LinkedIn. It also changes the tone of what this social network can be. Not a static look at what has been, but what you can be. Hope hooks the heart. LinkedIn right not hooks a self-loating mind.

People need to be someone you tap into from time to time. You don't necessarily follow all their updates. Let people join the content creators. 

It needs to be a content first platform. It needs to be about professional learning, and less about professional networking, which has truth-creep at its center (the tendency to exagerate and self-aggrandizement). Demonstrating knowledge is the real means of growth. That's it. Demonstrate knowledge, share your learnings, grow.
