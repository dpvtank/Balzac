The work of human life is find peace and happiness. The work of dharma is to help us find that peace and happiness, even in the chaos of life.

Even amidst the stresses and challenges of work, family, friends, employees and co-workers and customers. Of health issues and broken relationships and financial hardships, of aimlessness, and a sense of drifting. Through failure, and through success.

Dharma is that which upholds--peace, prosperity, happiness, and health personally and within a society or community. It is civilizational philosophy as well as a personal way of life.

When I look at the work of entrepreneurs, leaders, and anyone who is trying to make something happen in this world, I find there is a general fight.

Mental health issues, discord, sleeplessness, illness, burnout, and other signs of weariness. In some people, it is a general coldness, a sterile disembodiment from their own lives to "grind" or "hustle".

In others, it manifests as an imbalanced type of growth. They are profoundly in love with their work but completely alone and starving for love, affection, and relationships.

Relationships too have become laden with the baggage of the world.

What is at the heart of this discord? What are the deep cultural and mental narratives that inform this? Mindfulness, meditation, are useful tools, but uprooted from their Dharmic roots and purpose, their benefits are temporary. Meditation and mindfulness become tools to find respite, but not necessarily re-balance and re-adjust our broken selves.

Let's try to understand these one by one.

1. Dharma 

What is the dharma of a leader, an entrepreneur, a whatever.

I am reminded of a story of King Janak. He was a renowned King in India. One day, the massive city that he used to rule was set on fire. At that time, he said that the entire city is burning and his kingdom is coming to ruins but he was unaffected by it. He remained completely still throughout it all.

Often times, we think our leadership is what moves people. But that is not always the case. We often engage in leadership. Leadership is associated with the titles, the ranks we have. Increasingly as well, leadership is about unofficial and informal roles. Us taking a role leading an after-work community, or some event within our communities.

Somehow however, we have forgotten the inner work of leadership. I mean the work of character. I mean the work of attachment and detachment from outcomes.

Emerson, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Emerson, and other philosophers have based their understanding on the Gita and other ancient Vedic texts. I want to write about this. 

This is not stoicism. This is something much deeper and more profound.

Let us get into the Dharma of Leadership.

Dharma is simply that which upholds. Dharmic civilizations have historically allowed for openness, welcoming of differences, even if these other people have not necessarily been accepting of the concepts of a Dharmic civilization. It is the reason why Islam, Christiniaty, Zorastainism, Judaism, and other belief systems have thrived. It is the only civilization that has not violently expanded its borders.

Dharma is a system of thinking, a set of values, and a worldview, a way of life. Increasingly, while we wait for bestsellers to sign off on such ideas to give them credibility, note that they already have credibility by being alive for a few thousand years and having increasingly prospered (imperfectly sure, but that doesn't matter).

What are the lessons of Dharmic Leadership?

1. Intention without attachment.
2. Empathy and compassion for all, including yourself.
3. Inner realization as a parallel task for harmonious outer growth.
4. Understanding Balance.

These 4 ideas can be seen as the foundation for Dharmic Leadership.

Let's explore each of these in turn and apply them to a leadership situation you're facing.

1. Leadership without attachment
Janak Raja and Mithila burning. Being completely unaffected by it. Work and live without attachment. Not tetherless. But attached to the right things.
2. Inner realization
You are the atma, not the body-mind. And your nature is something much greater than the temporary waves of the world. And this is who everyone else. There is no good and evil.
