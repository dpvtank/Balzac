<h1>Biography</h1>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>

It took a lifetime to understand what matters in my life, but the heart of it came to me in an instant in the dusty heat of an ashram in India. A 90-year-old monk brought me home to myself, and here to you.

My life changed on 26 January 2001. A 7.7 Mw earthquake shook my hometown of Ahmedabad, India. In 2 minutes, over 13,000 lives became dust. Within a month, my parents got the opportunity to start afresh in Canada. Overnight, my father went from being a media professional to working in call centers and mall kiosks. My mother worked double shifts as a cashier. I remember she once walked home in -4 F or -20 C to save $2.50 on the bus ride. She almost got frostbite on her toes!

I was 11 and I was homesick in this new land which was so cold. Pushing aside these overwhelming feelings aside of guilt, loneliness, and inadequecy, I started working hard. I forced myself to enter debating competitions, and act in dramas to beat my "wallflower" reputation. I attended the<a href="http://uwo.ca"> University of Western Ontario</a>, one of the oldest in the country where I studied business at the renowned <a href="http://ivey.uwo.ca">Richard Ivey School of Business</a>, one of the best business schools in the country. I was in a rush to succeed, and I believed I could quickly conquer the corporate world. Alexander had conquered the world by his 20s. Why not me?

<h2>Climbing the Ladder</h2>

Foolishly, I was out of my depth. My classmates were groomed in prep schools their entire lives and their parents had buildings named after them across the world. I, on the other hand, was ashamed to keep cycling through the same three shirts in class. My view of the world was starkly different than theirs, and I was constantly reminded of how different I was. Instead of embracing my uniqueness, I started questioning it.

Upon graduation, I started at <a href="http://bell.ca">Bell</a>, a top three telecom in Canada, in their new graduate program. My performance reviews exceeded expectations. I was quickly noticed by senior executives, and on track to being a Director in just 2-3 years. I had finally made it, despite the road-bumps! But, why did it leave me so empty inside?

I was caught in a whirlwind of confusion. So, I did the only sensible thing possible: I went to live in an ashram in India in 2012.

<h2>The Ladder Breaks!</h2>

"In the joy of others lies our own" was <a href="http://pramukhswami.org/opinions/">Pramukh Swamiji's</a> motto. His work had touched millions of lives through hospitals, schools, relief work, and personal guidance he had given to the simplest villager and the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence:_My_Spiritual_Experiences_with_Pramukh_Swamiji">President Abdul Kalam</a> and Bill Clinton. Yet, he did not claim credit for this work, which mystified me.

Over many months, he taught me. Through service and meditation, I glimpsed my true self as being sat-chit-ᾶnand: filled with consciousness, truth, and bliss—an eternal being here to grow, learn, and contribute. My life's work was meant to be a gift and of service to others. Somehow, in the process of trying to "prove myself" to the world, I had forgotten that. No wonder I felt so disconnected. He reminded me of this truth. I had to bring this to my life, and make my life about serving others.

<blockquote>"In the Joy of Others Lies Our Own"- Pramukh Swamiji</blockquote>

I also met many others at this ashram. They were engineers, doctors, and lawyers. They were Harvard and Oxford grads. And yet, so many of these outwardly successful people had given it all up to take up the monastic order. Their stories helped me appreciate the meaning of a well-lived life. They became monks to be of service to a higher spiritual order and it became clear that I would not find satisfaction either unless I centered my career on serving others.

<h2>There and Back Again</h2>

Many others felt disconnected from their work and lives back home. I wanted them to experience this different story. I spent the rest of 2012 and most of 2013 working on a 200-page play. We took this story to young people worldwide. Our last show happened in August 2013 in Atlanta where we performed in front of an international audience of over 3,300. I was the lead actor.

The story deeply affected the thousands who saw it. Many resolved to change their lives and careers to be of greater service to others. I learned that a powerful story can change lives.

In 2014, I started at <a href="http://ups.com">UPS</a>. I made logistics accessible to my clients—large enterprises and start-ups—and brought in millions, exceeding all performance in the process. When a medical device company needed to safely deliver medical equipment to a woman’s clinic in Afghanistan threatened by the Taliban, I was brought in to make it happen. My insecurity and fear had left me as I worked with CEOs in the boardroom and warehouse workers. I learned to build global teams, solve complex global supply chain problems, but mostly importantly, I learned to serve others in business by getting out of my own way. This is when I started advising start-ups on how to grow and how to remain grounded.

Since then, I've worked with dozens of organizations across the US &amp; Canada, attended the <a href="http://schulich.yorku.ca">Schulich School of Business</a> at <a href="http://yorku.ca">York University</a> to receive an MBA, and become a thought leader at the <a href="http://symposium.org">St. Gallen Symposium</a> in Switzerland.

<h2>Finding A Purpose</h2>

Looking at organizations from within, I have come to the realization that the surest way to make the biggest impact in the world is to help leaders do better. It is to help business succeed. I believe strongly that free markets and commerce are the best way to eradicate poverty, give people a feeling of dignity in their work, and give purpose.

However, when I worked with companies and inside companies, I noticed a crisis of thought leadership. It became clear that the primary work of leaders was to make decisions and sell those decisions to others.

Yet, most leaders and decision makers found it hard to make decisions. They found it hard to move forward. Strategy, marketing, operations, sales: no matter what the department, it was ultimately a lack of insight that kept organizations stuck and stagnating.

I wanted to change this. I see my mission to help leaders make sound decisions to grow and build their organizations while finding greater satisfaction in their work.

My vision is to empower 100,000 leaders and decision-makers to make bold, courageous, and positive decisions for themselves, their organizations, and society. There is tremendous technological, economical, environmental changes coming our way. I believe strongly that the proper way to deal with these challenges begins with the inner work of changing our beliefs, our actions, our attitudes, our minds, and our hearts.

<h2>Today</h2>

This is why I write. This is why I speak. My goal on this site is to share the best ideas I can gather to make this possible. I do not want these to just be intellectual ideas that don't create change. I want to live them, and then write about it.

I advise <a href="http://mythicmarkets.com">Mythic Markets</a> and <a href="http://threegood.com">Three Good</a>.
