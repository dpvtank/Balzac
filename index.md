  More than there, there is a disconnect between business & people. Leadership
  and staff. Parents from their kids. What we need is a Dharmic Lens again to
  remake our businesses, societies, & families. It is a millennia old way of
  viewing ourselves, the people around us, and a way to see, think and live in
  this world.

Each week, I send out 1 email for leaders, entrepreneurs, makers, artists, teachers, thinkers, and doers. It’s an inquiry into your own experiences to become a more balanced person.

I believe that brain food alone cannot nourish life. Let's have a heart to heart.
