# The Dharma of the Entrepreneurship

This topic is going to potentially make you uncomfortable.

Out of all the ancient civilizations, only two have lasted. One went through a massive cultural revolution, which killed tens of millions of people. The other remaining civilization is the Dharmic civilization.

The Dharmic civilization that is not centered in India has had an interesting relationship to the world.

At a time when the church and state were one, where dreams of a Caliphate ruled, the Dharmic civilization welcomed people from other traditions, beliefs, ways of life, and religions and let them live. They were given land, and given opportunities to trade and become members of society.

This is because of a core tenet of Dharmic civilizations that valued diversity and openness inherently, not inspite of its beliefs. The result has been an imperfect, but a growing civilization that has not existed to conquer, overthrow, convert, or destroy another civilization.

We have much to learn from this Dharmic Civilization. Its lessons gives us a blueprint to remake the economy, remake entrepreneurship, and create a better society.

## What is Dharma?

Dharma is that which upholds. It is one of 4 key endaveours of life for a follower of a Dharmic tradition (which includes Hinduism & Buddhism).

It was the collective knowledge of people about ways of thinking, acting, and living that upheld the well-being of the individual, the family, the organization, and the collective.

Dharma was the first tenet that was applied to the pursuit of artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (enlightenment). Together, these are known as the 4 endeavours.

Let's try to understand what this means in practice.

## In Practice

Upholding the collective well-being of others is a large task. The simplest way this was practiced was in the way food was gathered, collected, shared, and eaten.

There is a reason why Dharmic traditions encourage eating plants over animals. While at some times, or in some geographies, animals were needed for food, most Dharmic civilizations tried to minimize the violence done to animals.

It also meant more people could be fed plants vs the inefficient process of cultivating massive amounts of plants to feed a significantly smaller number of animals, which feeds a lot less people in total.

We're seeing this practicality in action with rise of alternative protein companies like Beyond and Impossible which emphasizes plants over animals.

But the case for not eating animals was greater than that. A society that commits such massive amounts of violence to merely feed itself cannot create harmony.

We see this in play today with the massive amounts PTSD, and a staggering rise of chronic diseases that are mostly contributable to dietary misalignment (i.e. eating far too much animal meat or animal milk vs plants).

Eating plants today is becoming the main ways of reducing or eliminating the rise of more pandemics, saving the environment, and saving our health and consciences at the same time.

All this can be traced back to the first principles of non-violence as a primary means of living.

This one principle manages to uphold, sustain, and optimize an individual's health, a family's and a society's well being.

## The inaneness of tech determinism

While Twitter, Product Hunt, and other virtual gatherings go crazy at the mention of the new, for many of us, we cannot help but ponder on the general inaneness and self-importance by this bubble where techies make something for more techies that are making products to help techies make products for techies.

Surely, we've missed the boat in creating something here.

And I think it goes to the core of the idea where technology isn't meant to be something that creates happiness. Meditation apps, and employees that meditate are less productive over time anyways. There is something profoundly wrong with the tech deterministic people.

Aside: tech determinism is the idea that technology solves all problems.

But the human mind and the human heart is not a problem to solve. Coordination of diverse perspective is not a problem to solve. Tech tools can coordinate data and compile and collate ideas and perspectives. And somehow, the bubble rewards this type of endless brain food. But this alone can't be it. It just can't.

The inaneness is blinding. The endless obsession with the new. The hive-mind of VCs all tweeting and talking about the same things.

One day it is the newest product, the other day it is everyone talking about digital gardens and the power of note taking, and another day it is about starting a substack.

Let's ask ourselves: is this really helping me? Is this endless brain food and conversations really making me happier?

In pursuit of the new, we've forgotten the real reason why we create: for happiness. And more than happiness, for peace, for feeling like life is enough.

And isn't that the point of life?

I think entrepreneurs are missing out on filling this most fundamental of human needs.

If an economy advances enough, our pursuits are meant to change from worrying about the needs of the human body and mind towards the goals of self-actualization and self-transcendence.

So far we haven't gotten there. Sadly, we haven't enough gotten to a place where we can say that our physical needs are met. 

Everyone is trying to "solve" healthcare. For most of us, we know what actually needs to happen. Eat plants, move, don't smoke, get vaccinated. There, that's 90% of chronic diseases eliminated. Problem "Solved". Of course, this isn't a solution at all. This is an invitation to do the hard work of working in our communities to do worthwhile work. This isn't sexy. It doesn't get you featured on Product Hunt or trending on Twitter.

Yet, I believe this is the true work of entrepreneurship.

## Run Away From the Four Hour Workweek

What a toxic idea! Everyone is running a game of build a SaaS company, make enough, and retire and go live in Bali.

What a waste. I don't know about you, but the true thing that we all need is to work for a lifetime. Not because we are forced to due to financial lack, but because we want to.

I fail to see how this is the call of the human heart. A life lived for just ourselves is a shallow and unfulfilling life.

Many people say that this base lets them create freedom to actually go out and do this work. I am unconvinced.

What is the cost of this pursuit? I believe this disconnect is the main reason why founders, entrepreneurs, leaders, CEOs are so burned out, so stressed, in such a pit of mental health. We know that you folks are some of the most affected when it comes to mental health issues.

The real reason why you fail to experience it is the general inaneness of what you are creating. The soul is not involved.

(I can hear people scream in turn: How dare you! I gave my heart and soul in this! Yes, I'm sure you did, but giving your soul to the wrong things can be just as harmful).

Let's, for a moment, re-think the whole paradigm. Let's rethink what entrepreneurship is supposed to be. Let's re-think what happiness, peace, and contentment feel like. Let's re-think what contribution feels like. Let's understand what a fulfilling financial life feels like. Let's re-think what a resilient economy feels like.

What is the point of an economy that cannot make its people happy, content, and at peace?

VCs search for endless growth. Of problems, in creating demand for things.

Unfortunately, endless growth of human problems and needs and endless solution to this topic is not what we want or need.

Instead, the work of entrepreneurs should be to limit the wants and needs.

We don't need more VCs in the world. We don't need Venture Capitalists. We need a different person altogether. Each community with someone who can be the hub of fulfilling the human wants and needs of a lifetime.

## Religion and Work

Talk about religion, God and people freeze up. God is meant to be a separate entity, removed from the idea of work.

But I come from a Dharmic lens. The Dharmic lens did not insist on conversion.

Religion has been the first teacher of being content, of less. It's just that most traditions either fattened their coffers as they preached the opposite. Not always the case with Dharmic traditions.

What we need is dharma, a religion that can take us back there.

Self-actualization, and ultimately self-transcendence sits here. A spiritual practice is needed. We need a cadre of people helping people downsize, find happiness in less.

Not the fake minimalism of Apple designed products. Clean lines do not imply simplicity.

What we need is the ability to go work on self-actualization and then self-transcendence.
