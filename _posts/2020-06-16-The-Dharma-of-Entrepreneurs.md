# The Dharma of the Entrepreneurship

This topic is going to potentially make you uncomfortable.

Out of all the ancient civilizations, only two have lasted. One went through a massive cultural revolution, which killed tens of millions of people. The other remaining civilization is the Dharmic civilization.

The Dharmic civilization that is not centered in India has had an interesting relationship to the world.

At a time when the church and state were one, where dreams of a Caliphate ruled, the Dharmic civilization welcomed people from other traditions, beliefs, ways of life, and religions and let them live. They were given land, and given opportunities to trade and become members of society.

This is because of a core tenet of Dharmic civilizations that valued diversity and openness inherently, not inspite of its beliefs. The result has been an imperfect, but a growing civilization that has not existed to conquer, overthrow, convert, or destroy another civilization.

We have much to learn from this Dharmic Civilization. Its lessons gives us a blueprint to remake the economy, remake entrepreneurship, and create a better society.

## What is Dharma?

Dharma is that which upholds. It is one of 4 key endaveours of life for a follower of a Dharmic tradition (which includes Hinduism & Buddhism).

It was the collective knowledge of people about ways of thinking, acting, and living that upheld the well-being of the individual, the family, the organization, and the collective.

Dharma was the first tenet that was applied to the pursuit of artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (enlightenment). Together, these are known as the 4 endeavours.

Let's try to understand what this means in practice.

## In Practice

Upholding the collective well-being of others is a large task. The simplest way this was practiced was in the way food was gathered, collected, shared, and eaten.

There is a reason why Dharmic traditions encourage eating plants over animals. While at some times, or in some geographies, animals were needed for food, most Dharmic civilizations tried to minimize the violence done to animals.

It also meant more people could be fed plants vs the inefficient process of cultivating massive amounts of plants to feed a significantly smaller number of animals, which feeds a lot less people in total.

We're seeing this practicality in action with rise of alternative protein companies like Beyond and Impossible which emphasizes plants over animals.

But the case for not eating animals was greater than that. A society that commits such massive amounts of violence to merely feed itself cannot create harmony.

We see this in play today with the massive amounts PTSD, and a staggering rise of chronic diseases that are mostly contributable to dietary misalignment (i.e. eating far too much animal meat or animal milk vs plants).

Eating plants today is becoming the main ways of reducing or eliminating the rise of more pandemics, saving the environment, and saving our health and consciences at the same time.

All this can be traced back to the first principles of non-violence as a primary means of living.

This one principle manages to uphold, sustain, and optimize an individual's health, a family's and a society's well being.
