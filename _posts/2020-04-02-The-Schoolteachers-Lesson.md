title: The Schoolteacher's Lesson & Choosing Yourself

We wait too long for others to choose us. We wait for the right 
schools, universities, employers, partners to choose us. We wait for 
someone else to give us permission to do what we really want to do. To 
learn what we want to learn, to make what we want to make.

Self-directed learning via online courses and books are more abundant
 than ever before. But my mind goes to why we so often fail at following
 through, on learning ourselves, or insisting that we get the right 
credentials.

On waiting for someone else to choose us.

### The Seven Lesson School Teacher

Meet John Taylor Gatto.

John Taylor Gatto from [The Ultimate History Lesson](https://tragedyandhope.com/th-films/the-ultimate-history-lesson/)

He was New York State’s and New York City’s Teacher of the Year for 3
 years. He took underperforming kids and made them into smart, 
interesting, curious, and well prepared individuals. In short, he did 
what great teachers do.

It was during the last year where he won the Teacher of the Year 
award that he wrote a very public column in the Wall Street Journal 
announcing that he was quitting teaching for good.

He said he was done harming kids.

He believed that the real lessons of school were very different than what we believe them to be. These lessons are:

1.  Confusion: Schools teach us everything, disconnectedly. Math is 
    different from history is different from science is different from 
    language. But true education is meant to be an in-depth understanding of
     the world and to develop a skill set that can serve us navigate it. 
    That is how the world functions. Everything is meant to be integrated. 
    Schools teach unrelating everything from everything. It isn’t until much
     later years where the synthesis of these things come together.
2.  Indifference:
     Classes are strictly divided into a timetable. English is homeroom, 
    Science is second, and then math. You can have a great teacher at the 
    front of the class, but when the bell rings, you must stop and just shut
     off your brain and rapidly go do something else. No wonder we struggle 
    at finishing long term projects that matter in our lives in our adult 
    age. No wonder we struggle to keep focus on doing deep work, which is 
    where mastery and greatness happens.
3.  Position: Students are 
    numbered, and they are put in a strict position. You know what your 
    position is, and you don’t like to deviate from it. I see this (and it’s
     happened with me as well), where it is very difficult to relate and 
    connect with people of different age groups, different socio-economic 
    factors. We know our position, and our world starts revolving only 
    around people in the right class, the right subjects, the right 
    position. This is not the way the real world is supposed to work. No 
    wonder we are so divided. Why we struggle to see the other person.
4.  Emotional
     Dependence: The golden star stickers in the report card, the permission
     to go use the bathroom, the rankings and class performance charts. They
     all teach us that we need someone else to bestow their good graces upon
     us so that we may express our individuality. There is value in this of 
    course. When we are small children, we need this to teach us social 
    norms to function well. But after a while, we keep chasing the golden 
    star sticker in everything we do, from the universities we want to go 
    to, the jobs we pursue, the vacations we take. Everything is a signal 
    waiting for someone else to validate us and give us permission to be. 
    There is no outlet to fight against this.
5.  Self-esteem 
    dependence: Of course a result of the above issue is that our confidence
     is highly tied to how someone else approves of us or not. You are 
    constantly evaluated and judged. A quiz a day, a test a week, exams, 
    etc. Most of us remember the relief of the summer vacation. When we 
    returned from these vacations, we ourselves know how little we remember 
    from what we learned the year before. Instead, it was only the things 
    that we were interested in that stayed with us. But despite that, the 
    grade we get can devastate us or make us.
6.  Intellectual 
    Dependence: Someone else always sets the agenda of what we need to 
    learn, and how we must learn. We wait for instructions. Someone tells us
     we are Wrong (with a capital W) when we get something incorrect. I have
     barely used the tools from my English classes in school, but yet back 
    then there was a correct way of doing things and an incorrect way. We 
    are supposed to learn self-evaluation. But instead, we wait for others. 
    This carries over to performance and annual reviews in jobs. Instead of 
    focusing on continuous self-driven improvement, we wait for someone 
    else.

Of course the question becomes, if schools are so ineffective, how 
else are people supposed to learn? But learning was always supposed to 
be a self-driven thing. And teaching kids to be motivated to self-learn,
 self-evaluate, and chase their own interests and how it relates to 
everything else is supremely more powerful.

This isn’t about becoming drop-outs. This is about understanding the 
hidden lessons we have learned in school and what it has done to us. I 
highly recommend looking through John Taylor Gatto’s books (do we even 
have the concentration to read a full book anymore?) to think about 
alternative ways of learning.

It is heartening to hear things changing. A great family friend whom I
 had the pleasure of spending a weekend with last month told us she was 
homeschooling her two kids. She comes from a conservative Hindu family, 
and she herself has a PhD in Chemistry from a major American university 
on the west coast. It was amazing to see her insistence on this.

Forced to stay at home, many of us with kids are waking up and are 
faced with a choice to either hand our kids a screen so they can 
distract and entertain themselves, or engage in serious self-directed 
study and learning. Self-directed being the key here.

Consider looking into the unschooling, self-direct learning 
movements, and home schooling movements if you have kids. These children
 have and can grow up to be marvelously well rounded and successful 
people (that’s what the data shows).

In the meantime, we all need to unschool ourselves a little bit as 
well. The mental baggage can slow ourselves. Being aware of it is 
sometimes all we need to unload it.

In short, we need to choose ourselves.

That’s how we make this time of isolation into a time of 
productivity. Where we let our own self-directed curiosity guide us to 
grow. That is because ideas are powerful.

### On great ideas

Ideas are the real currency of this century. I’ve gotten work without
 resumes and cover letters, just through the strength of ideas. This 
week alone, I was contacted on Twitter by an entrepreneur for a major 
(at least for me) business transaction based on the strength of my 
ideas. I’ve gotten large consulting projects through cold emails and the
 strength of my ideas. And of course sharing those ideas.

I’d like to encourage all of us to please do share your ideas! What 
are you learning? What are you thinking about? What are you curious 
about? Help me be of service to you by either making me a sounding board
 or someone who can recommend a book, course, or resource to guide you 
through your curiosity.

I share one idea a week. Consider signing up for it in a weekly newsletter below:
