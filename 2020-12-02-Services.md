## How to make 2021 vastly more profitable than 2020

Dear Business Owner,

Do you have a plan for how to make the new year more focused and profitable? 

Most businesses don’t. Sure, they might upgrade their offices, add a few more products and services, and advertise a bit more. But there’s no real strategy there.

After working with dozens of businesses to 2x, 5x, and 10x their revenues, I’ve learned one thing. The single most important thing you need to grow is to have a clear strategy. You cannot “wing” it.

Most people get this plan wrong. They think it is about slick websites, fancy brochures, and advertising spend. This isn’t the case.

If you removed your logo, would your customers even be able to tell you apart from your competitors? 

The answer for 9/10 businesses is **NO**.

Growth is hard work. Not everyone can do it. You need someone who knows what they're doing.

### That’s what I’d like to help you create—risk free###

The first thing I’m going to do for you is to personally create a plan to bring in immediate money. 

There’s no charge for this and it takes only a 45-60 minute conversation to get started.

I’ll do the hard work of thinking through your business and telling you **exactly** what you need to do. This might involve:
      
    • building smart lists to attract new buyers...
    • pulling in past buyers with different offers...
    • building out a unique value proposition...
    • re-engaging prospects into customers…
    • using data models to find new prospects…
    • and more...

My goal is to get you excited about the opportunities ahead and _get crystal clear clarity on how to get there_.

At the end of the call, you will at least have a great promotion you can launch within a day or two. And get more customers coming in through the door again.

At this point, **one of two things will happen**:

1. You will love the plan and decide to put in place it yourself. In which case, I will wish you well and hope that you will stay in touch with me as you execute it.

2. You will love the plan and become my client so I can work with you directly to execute and profit from it.

It really is that simple and there is no catch. There is little downside and a massive upside. 

### Why do I do this?###

Two reasons:

One, it is enormously fun to work with business owners and help them grow their business. It gives me a rush to unlock levers of growth for you.

Second, this is how I get clients. Assuming you’re happy with the ideas we discuss, you’ll probably want to continue working together so I can execute them for you.

At that point, you will pay my “fee”...but if you think about it, it doesn’t really “cost” you anything.

Why?

Because I expect to make you a lot more than what you’re investing in me.

My promise to you: If you don’t want to become a client, don’t worry about it. You won’t get any sales pitch or pressure from me. That’s not how I sell. I sell based on the strength of my ideas to deliver results for you and my track record.

Consider what some of my former clients have said:

> If you’re a business owner that wants real leverage to grow, you absolutely need a great marketing person. I believe Dhawal is that person. His ideas work practically for startups, as well as small and medium sized companies. I highly recommend working with him to grow your business.
- Lelian Girard, CEO, TUIO Payments

> He is one of the most diligent, patient and honest men I have met. It is my sincere pleasure to recommend him to anybody out there looking for RESULTS.

- Aditya Gullia, Serial Entrepreneur and CEO of Grace & Stella.

> I rank Dhawal as one of the best advisors I have ever had. He has an art for finding and acquiring new pockets of customers in a way that produces tangible results.
- Sharon King, CEO, Starfield.

I've worked with dozens of clients across 10+ industries. They range in size from $100,000 to $9,000,000 in revenues. You can read my endorsement letters and testimonials on dtank.co/endorsements.

In other words, you are getting someone who can do strategy and execution as well. I can think across industries to bring you unorthodox ideas to help you stand out from your competitors. You get the pedigree, a track record of success, and the professionalism to work as a trusted advisor with you to navigate growth. 

### How to get started ###

It’s very simple.
    1. Go to calendly.com/dtankco
    2. Pick a time that works for you in the next 7-10 days where we can speak over a Zoom call.
    3. Show up on the call!

We will begin to figure out exactly what you want...and how to get there.

I’ll thoroughly review your goals, your current situation, and deliver a plan of attack!

If at the end of the call, you want to work with me, great, let’s talk more about it. And if not, then there are no hard feelings at all.

You have a risk free way to work to see me in action this way and we can vet each other.

### WARNING: This Offer is Time-Sensitive ###

I only work with a limited number of clients at a time. My work can be fairly intense and I do not stretch myself thin. I do not outsource my work either. And 2021 is already starting to fill up with requests coming in.

So don’t delay to setup a time to speak now.

Go to calendly.com/dtankco and fill out the form to get started.

Best wishes,

Dhawal Tank
